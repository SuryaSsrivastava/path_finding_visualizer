# Shortest path visualizer

## Dijastra Algorithm

Below are the detailed steps used in Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm to find the shortest path from a single source vertex to all other vertices in the given graph.
Algorithm

```

function Dijkstra(Graph, source):
2:	for each vertex v in Graph:	// Initialization
3:	    dist[v] := infinity	// initial distance from source to vertex v is set to infinite
4:	previous[v] := undefined	// Previous node in optimal path from source
5:	dist[source] := 0	// Distance from source to source
6:	Q := the set of all nodes in Graph	// all nodes in the graph are unoptimized - thus are in Q
7:	while Q is not empty:	// main loop
8:	    u := node in Q with smallest dist[ ]
9:	    remove u from Q
10:	    for each neighbor v of u:	// where v has not yet been removed from Q.
11:	        alt := dist[u] + dist_between(u, v)
12:	        if alt < dist[v]	// Relax (u,v)
13:	            dist[v] := alt
14:	            previous[v] := u
15:	return previous[ ]

```

## A* Algorithm

```
make an openlist containing only the starting node
   make an empty closed list
   while (the destination node has not been reached):
       consider the node with the lowest f score in the open list
       if (this node is our destination node) :
           we are finished 
       if not:
           put the current node in the closed list and look at all of its neighbors
           for (each neighbor of the current node):
               if (neighbor has lower g value than current and is in the closed list) :
                   replace the neighbor with the new, lower, g value 
                   current node is now the neighbor's parent            
               else if (current g value is lower and this neighbor is in the open list ) :
                   replace the neighbor with the new, lower, g value 
                   change the neighbor's parent to our current node

               else if this neighbor is not in both lists:
                   add it to the open list and set its g
